# Preface

Probably the largest hurdle when learning any new programming language is simply unknowing where to get started. This is why I decided to create this repository about Python for Beginners!

Even though this repository won’t be covering everything there is to know about Python, I want to make sure I give you the foundation on programming in Python, starting from common everyday code and scenarios. At the end of the repository, you’ll be able to go and learn on your own, for example with docs, tutorials, or books.

Examples of this section are derived from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python for Beginners Videos</a>by Microsoft Developer.

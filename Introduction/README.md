<b> Preface </b> </p> 
</p>     

Probably the largest hurdle when learning any new programming language is simply unknowing where to get started. This is why I decided to create this section of the repository about Python for Beginners!

Even though this section of the repository won’t be covering everything there is to know about Python, I want to make sure I give you the foundation on programming in Python, starting from common everyday code and scenarios. At the end of the repository, you’ll be able to go and learn on your own, for example with docs, tutorials, or books.

Examples of this section are derived from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6">Python for Beginners Videos</a> by Microsoft Developer.

<b>Getting Started with Python in VS Code</b> </p> 
</p>     

Working with Python in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial), using the Microsoft Python extension, is simple, fun, and productive. The extension makes VS Code an excellent Python editor, and works on any operating system with a variety of Python interpreters. It leverages all of VS Code's power to provide auto complete and IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and unit testing, along with the ability to easily switch between Python environments, including virtual and conda environments.
